# House-Price-Predction-Advanced-Regression
House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques is a machine learning project originally created as a Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the sale price of houses based on various features. The project was widely popular among data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts, and many participants submitted their models to compete for the top leaderboard positions.

After the competition ended, the project was made available as an open source codebase on GitHub. This allows developers to continue working on the project, improving the accuracy of the model, and experimenting with different feature engineering and modeling techniques.

The GitHub repository contains all the necessary files to get started with the project, including the original dataset, sample code, and Jupyter notebooks. The project is organized in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for developers to navigate through the code and understand the logic behind each step.

The project is a valuable resource for developers who want to improve their machine learning skills, as it provides a real-world dataset and a well-defined problem to solve. By working on the project, developers can gain experience in feature engineering, data cleaning, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, they can contribute to the project by submitting their own models and improving the performance of the model on the test set.

Overall, House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques is a great project for anyone interested in machine learning, data science, and real estate. The project offers a challenging problem, a well-defined dataset, and a supportive community that is willing to help newcomers get started with the project.
